# MetaMap Lite

## System Description

### Processing stages

MetaMapLite segments text using sentence or blank line markers using
OpenNLP's sentence segmenter or MetaMapLite's blank line seqmenter.
Tokenizes sentences using tokenizer based of Original MetaMap's
tokenization regime.  Part-of-speech information is added to tokenized
text using OpenNLP's part-of-speech tagger.  Mapping is done by
dividing sentence or line based chunks into sublists and then each
sublist is normalized and then looked up in a dictionary.  Any match
found in the dictionary that is subsumed by a longer match is
discarded.

MetaMapLite processing stages

    input text ->
      sentence/line segmentation ->
        tokenization ->
          part-of-speech tagging ->
            token window generation ->
              term normalization ->
                concept dictionary lookup ->
                  negation detection ->
				  result presentation

Below is an example of sentence level named entity recognition in
which a token list for the sentence "Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma is a
Unique Clinical Entity." is processed.

Given the example:

        "Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma is a Unique Clinical Entity."
      
The token-based sublists are produced as follows:

        "Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma is a Unique Clinical Entity"
        "Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma is a Unique Clinical"
        "Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma is a Unique"
        "Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma is a"
        "Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma is"
        "Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma"   --> match
                                    "is a Unique Clinical Entity"
                                    "is a Unique Clinical"
                                    "is a Unique"
	                                "is a"
		                            "is"
	                                   "a Unique Clinical Entity"
									   "a Unique Clinical"
									   "a Unique"
                                       "a"
								         "Unique Clinical Entity"
									     "Unique Clinical"
									     "Unique" --> match
									            "Clinical Entity"
									            "Clinical" --> match
                                                "Entity" --> match

Four entities are found by MetaMapLite:

       "Papillary Thyroid Carcinoma"
       "Unique"
	   "Clinical"
	   "Entity"

### Term Normalization

MetaMapLite normalizes the terms in the current token window using a
Java implementation of of MetaMap's Prolog predicate
`mwi_utilities:normalize_meta_string/2` (used by `filter_mrconso`)
with some slight modifications (including the removal of some
operations.)

The following operations are performed of the term before dictionary
lookup:

   * removal of (left []) parentheticals;
   * syntactic uninversion;
   * conversion to lowercase;
   * stripping of possessives.

### Dictionary Lookup

The underlying dictionary lookup uses a inverted file implemenations
where the dictionary is divided in to several partitions where each
partition contains only terms which have the same termlength.  The
implementation uses the Java NIO class java.nio.MappedByteBuffer to
access the systems virtual memory facilities to improve I/O
performance.

### Negation Detection

Wendy Chapman's ConText is used for negation detection using the
current sentence and the list of found entities.


### An Alternative Implementation of Negation Detection

#### Dealing with Conjunctions

Given sentence:

    "Tylenol was effective in patients without fever but effective in patients with headache."

Separate utterances delimited by conjunction "but", "cause for", etc.

    "Tylenol was effective in patients without fever"  (negate "fever", trigger: "without")
    "but"
    "effective in patients with headache"              (do not negate "headache")

Given sentence:

    "The patient denies chest pain but has no shortness of breath."

Similarly, the independent clause delimited by the coordinating
conjunction may each contain a negation phrase.

     "The patient denies chest pain"  (negate "chest pain", trigger: "denies")
     "but"
     "has no shortness of breath."    (negate "shortness of breath", trigger: "no")


### Dictionaries

MetaMapLite currently uses three dictionaries originally created for MetaMap:

    cuiconcept
    cuisourceinfo
    cuist

#### cuisourceinfo

This is the table used for mapping strings in the input text to
concepts, this is the primary dictionary used by MetaMapLite.

Each record contains the UMLS concept identifier, UMLS string
identifier, a sequence number, the source derived string, the source
abbreviation, and the source term type:

    cui|sui|seqno|string|src|tty

Sample records are below:

    C0000005|S0007492|1|(131)I-Macroaggregated Albumin|MSH|PEN
    C0000005|S0007491|2|(131)I-MAA|MSH|EN
    C0000039|S0007564|1|1,2-Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine|MSH|MH

    cui|semantic type abbreviation

Usually, there are several records for each UMLS concept:

    C0000005|aapp
    C0000005|irda
    C0000005|phsu
    C0000039|orch

#### meshtcrelaxed

This table maps terms to MeSH treecodes for terms that are present in
MeSH. Each record contains the term and its associated treecode.  Term
that do not have a treecode are mapped to "x.x.x.x".

    term|treecode

## Dictionary and Postings File Organization

The dictionary is constructed as several partitions, each partition
consists of three files for each set of terms of a specific length
from a specific column of the originating table: a dictionary
characteristics file, a term-dictionary file, and a postings extents
file.  These files refer to a global postings file used by all of the
partitions.  Each term-dictionary contains records of term with the
same length with the number of postings for the term and the address

Within the postings extents file
(*indexname*-*column*-*termlength*-partition-offsets) each record
contains address of posting with the length of the posting.

Each partition has four files, the file
*cuisourceinfo-3-30-term-dictionary-stats.txt* contains term and record
lengths along with the number of records in the partition:

    termlength|30
    reclength|46
    datalength|16
    recordnum|76361

The file *cuisourceinfo-3-30-term-dictionary* is a binary file of records,
all the same length with each record containing a term, the number of
postings for that term and address of the posting extents for that
term:

    |            term              | # of postings | address |
    +------------------------------+---------------+---------+
    |Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine|       4       | FFF4556 | 


The file *cuisourceinfo-3-30-partition-offsets* is a binary file that
contains the start and end offsets (the extent) of each posting:

    | address | start |  len  |
    +---------+-------+-------+
    | FFF4556 |   58  |   57  |
    |   ...   |  176  |   66  |
    |   ...   |  279  |   59  |
    |   ...   |    0  |   58  |

Defined in irutils.MultiKeyIndex.Extent (irutils/MultiKeyIndex.java):

    class Extent {
      /** address of posting */
      long start;
      /** length of posting */
      long end;
    }

The postings for all of the partitions reside in the file *postings*.

    address | data 
    --------+-------------------------------------------------------------------
          0 | C0000039|S0033298|4|Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine|SNMI|PT
         58 | C0000039|S0033298|7|Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine|LNC|CN
        176 | C0000039|S0033298|6|Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine|SNOMEDCT_US|OAP
        279 | C0000039|S0033298|5|Dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine|NDFRT|SY


The postings file is shared among all of the partitions.

## Dictionary and Postings File Construction

for each partition:

 + write temporary partition tables grouped by table column and term length.
 + write postings storing extent(offset,length) keyed by checksum of postings content
   and storing checksum list keyed by term.
 + write dictionary and extents after postings are written.
 + term to checksum map is discarded after partition is saved, checksum to extent map is preserved.

### Generating Tables and Indexes

The CreateIndexes class generates tables cuiconcept, cuisourceinfo,
cuist, meshtcrelaxed, and vars from MRCONSO.RRF, MRSTY.RRF, and MRSTY
and then produces corresponding indexes for tables.

Usage: 

     java -cp target/metamaplite-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar \
      gov.nih.nlm.nls.metamap.dfbuilder.CreateIndexes <mrconsofile> <mrstyfile> <mrsatfile> <ivfdir>

# Scoring

## MetaMap Scoring Components

Described in paper "MetaMap Evaluation", Alan R. Aronson,
https://ii.nlm.nih.gov/Publications/Papers/mm.evaluation.pdf

    score = 1000*((centrality + variation + coverage + cohesiveness)/6)

### Variation

An estimation of how much the variant in the Metathesaurus string
differ from the corresponding words in the phrase.

    (defn lexical-variation-sum
       "Sum of lexical variation of phrase to match the metastring"
       [phrase metastring]
       (map (fn [phrase-token metastring-token]
               (lexical-variation phrase-token metastring-token))
            (tokenize phrase) (tokenize metastring)))

### Coverage

   An indication of how much of the phrase string and the
   Metathesaurus string are involved in the match.




### Cohesiveness

   

### Involvement

## MetaMapLite Scoring Components

Currently based on MetaMap's Scoring Components

    score = 1000*((centrality + variation + (2.0*(coverage + cohesiveness)))/6.0)


## MMI Ranking

Describe in paper "MMI Ranking Function", Alan R. Aronson,
https://ii.nlm.nih.gov/Publications/Papers/ranking.pdf


## Maven Issues

These are related to the use of Antonio Jimeno Yepes' WSD library.

## Feature Requests

1. Support entity lookup using two separate dataset (UMLS and custom, etc.) 

## Known bugs

1. Semantic Type filter does not always filter out all excluded types
2. Abbreviation detector doesn't always work
